IrrduinoServer
==============

This is the server component of Irrduino.  It's a Python Google App Engine
application.

Running
-------

Make sure you have the Google App Engine for Python installed and run the
following from the current directory:

  dev_appserver.py .

If you want to setup an ssh tunnel from a public server back to your own
development server so that Irrduino can talk to your development server,
do something like:

  ssh -R \*:8080:127.0.0.1:8080 $USER@your-public-server.com

To deploy to the public server, just use GoogleAppEngineLauncher.  The
app is currently deployed to:

  http://irrduinoserver.appspot.com/

Configuring IrrduinoController
------------------------------

To get IrrduinoController to send us its logs, you must configure it.
To get the existing settings, go to:

  http://YOUR-SERVER-NAME/settings

To change it to use the default, public server, go to:

  http://YOUR-SERVER-NAME/settings?reportingEnabled=true&reportingHostName=irrduinoserver.appspot.com&reportingHostPort=80

To change it to use the development server (running over an ssh tunnel), go to
a slightly tweaked version of the URL below:

  http://YOUR-SERVER-NAME/settings?reportingEnabled=true&reportingHostName=your-public-server.com&reportingHostPort=8080

Limitations
-----------

I specifically decided not to write any tests because this is a prototype.
